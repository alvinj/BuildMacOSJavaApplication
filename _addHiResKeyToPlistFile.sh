# PURPOSE: add the "Hi-Res" key before the end of the plist file

# `APP_NAME` corresponds to the MacOS app name, such as `HelloWorld.app`
# or `FooBar.app`. This is the same name as the directory
# thatâ€™s created under the `release` directory, but without
# the `.app` extension at the end.

APP_NAME=HelloWorld
